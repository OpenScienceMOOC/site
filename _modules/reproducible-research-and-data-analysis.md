**Status**: This module is currently [in development](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-3-Reproducible-Research-and-Data-Analysis)

## Rationale

Reproducible research is at the heart of science. There has been an increased 
need and willingness to open and share research from the data collection right 
through to the interpretations of results. This has come with its own set of 
challenges, which include designing workflows that can be adopted by 
collaborators in a way that does not compromise the integrity of their 
contribution. This module will introduce the necessary tools required for 
transparent reporting which is reproducible and readable.

## Learning outcomes

* Researchers will be able to describe the key factors that affect the 
  reproducibility of research, including workflow design, data management, and 
  reporting.
* The researcher will be able to use a range of resources to create and implement 
  a workflow for reproducible research, including using lab notebooks and tools 
  for sharing code and data.
