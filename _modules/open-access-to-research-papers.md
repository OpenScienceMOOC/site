title: "Open Access to Research Papers"
---

## Rationale

Making scholarly research outputs openly available is easy, legal, and has 
demonstrable benefits to authors, making it a good beginning step for a 
researcher just beginning to explore the open world. There is a set of knowledge 
required to navigate the Open Access landscape, involving copyright, article 
status, repositories, and economics. This module will introduce key concepts and 
tools that can help a researcher make their work openly available and maximize 
the benefits to themselves and others.

## Learning outcomes

* The researcher will become familiar with the history of scholarly publishing, 
  and development of the present Open Access landscape.
* The researcher will gain a multi-stakeholder insight into Open Access, and be 
  able to convey a balanced overview of the perceived advantages and 
  disadvantages associated with Open Access publishing.
* The researcher will be able to describe some of the complexities of the current 
  the Open Access landscape, including allowances for self-archiving and 
  embargoes, copyright transfer, and publishing contracts.
* Based on community-specific practices, the researcher will be able to use the 
  different types of outlets (repositories) available for self-archiving, as well 
  as the range of Open Access journal types available to them.
* Each researcher will able to make all of their own research papers Open Access 
  through a combination of journals and development of a personal self-archiving 
  protocol.
* Researchers will be able to describe the current ebb and flow in the debates 
  around preprints, and be able to locate and use relevant disciplinary preprint 
  platforms.
* Researchers will be able to use services like ImpactStory to track the 
  proportion of their research that is Open Access.
