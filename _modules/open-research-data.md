## Rationale

Open research data refers to the publishing the data underpinning scientific 
research results so that they have no restrictions on their access. Openly 
sharing data opens it up to inspection and re-use, forms the basis for research 
verification and reproducibility, and opens up a path to broader collaboration. 
In this module, you will gain insight into the importance of data sharing for 
reproducible research and how to curate and share your own research data.

## Learning outcomes

* The researcher will be able to define the characteristics of open data, the 
  advantages and disadvantages associated with sharing different types of data 
  openly, and the FAIR principles.
* Researchers will be able to share their research data openly to a relevant 
  public repository in a way that conforms to the FAIR principles.
* The researcher will be able to locate and re-use datasets for their research 
  from relevant disciplinary repositories.
