**Status**: This module is currently [in development](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-4-Open-Research-Data)

## Rationale

Open research data refers to the publishing the data underpinning scientific 
research results so that they have no restrictions on their access. Openly 
sharing data opens it up to inspection and re-use, forms the basis for research 
verification and reproducibility, and opens up a path to broader collaboration. 
In this module, you will gain insight into the importance of data sharing for 
reproducible research and how to curate and share your own research data.

## Learning outcomes

At the end of this module, the participants will be able to:

1. Understand the benefits of embracing open data practices.
2. Recognize the importance of data documentation (metadata), by getting familiarized with the FAIR principles and the research data management concepts.
3. Identify data format issues and their relation to data archiving and analysis.
4. Publish data in a data repository relevant to their scientific discipline or community.
