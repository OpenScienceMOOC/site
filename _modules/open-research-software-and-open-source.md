## Rationale

Software and technology underpin modern science. There is an increasing demand 
for more sophisticated open source software, matched by an increasing 
willingness for researchers to openly collaborate on new tools. These 
developments come with a specific ethical, legal and economic challenges that 
impact upon research workflows. This module will introduce the necessary tools 
required for transforming software into something that can be openly accessed 
and re-used by others.

## Learning outcomes

* The researcher will be able to define the characteristics of open source 
  research software, and the ethical, legal, economic and research impact 
  arguments for and against it.
* Based on community standards, researchers will be able to describe the quality 
  requirements of sharing and re-using open code.
* The researcher will be able to use a range of research tools that utilise open 
  source software.
* Individual researchers will be able to transform code designed for their 
  personal use into code that is accessible and re-usable by others.
