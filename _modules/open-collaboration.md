**Status**: This module is currently [in development](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-2-Open-Collaboration)

## Rationale

Virtual Research Environments (VRE) are the way of the future in collaboration 
across continents, time zones and disciplines. While the definition of a VRE may 
be up for grabs, they provide powerful examples of high-performing modern 
research tools. In this module you will develop an understanding of collaborative 
platforms that work today, and how they can greatly enhance your research 
workflows.   

## Learning outcomes

* The researcher will become familiar with the range of options available to you 
  to aid greater collaborative research.
* After deciding what works optimally for their workflow, the researcher will be 
  able to use collaborative tools such as GitHub and the Open Science Framework 
  for increased collaboration for the research process, writing/authoring, and 
  sharing your research outputs.
* The researcher will be able to collaborate with colleagues to annotate 
  preprints or other published articles, and share this discussion with the 
  original authors and wider research community.
