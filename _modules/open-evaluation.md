**Status**: This module is currently [in development](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-7-Open-Evaluation)

## Rationale
Concurrent with broader developments in Open Science and increased transparency 
in research, Open Peer Review is a complex, and rapidly evolving topic. 
Alongside this, more diverse criteria of research evaluation beyond traditional 
methods are emerging, and with these come a range of practical, ethical, and 
social factors to consider. This module will provide insight into current 
developments in Open Peer Review and research evaluation.

## Learning outcomes

* The researcher will be able to describe the history of peer review in the 
  context of scholarly publishing, the criticisms levied against traditional 
  peer review, and the ongoing developments with Open Peer Review.
* The researcher will be able to use a range of post-publication review, 
  commenting, and annotation services.
* The researcher will be able to describe the issues associated with the use of 
  traditional metrics in research evaluation, and the role that peer evaluation 
  and next-generation metrics (or altmetrics) play in this.
* The researcher will be able to use a range of services to build and demonstrate 
  their personal research impact profile, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
* The researcher will become familiar with the relevant criteria for research 
  evaluation to them, and be able to have a critical discussion about them with 
  their colleagues and those who drafted them.
