title: "Open Principles"
---

**Status**: This module is currently [in development](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-1-Open-Principles/tree/master/content_development).

## Rationale

To innovate in a field frequently implies moving against prevailing trends and 
cultural inertia. Open Science is no different. No matter how convinced you are, 
you will come across resistance from peers and colleagues, and the best defence 
is strong personal conviction that what you are doing may not be perfect now, 
but is the right decision in the long run. This module will introduce the 
guiding principles of the ‘open movement’, the different actors involved, and 
the impact that they are having.   

## Learning outcomes

* The researcher will be able to describe the ethical, legal, social, economic, 
  and research impact arguments for and against Open Science.   
* After deciding which platforms/tools/services are most useful for themselves 
  and their community, the researcher will develop a personal profile for 
  showcasing their research profile and outputs.
* After reflecting on the status of Open Science within their research group or 
  lab, the researcher will devise concrete ways to locally improve open 
  practices.
* Using the guidelines published by their research laboratories, departments, or 
  institutes, researchers will identify the policies for career progression and 
  assessment, publishing and open access, data sharing, and intellectual property.
* Researchers will collaborate with colleagues and international peers to develop 
  a shared definition of Open Science.
