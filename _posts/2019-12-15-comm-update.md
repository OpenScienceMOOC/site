Dear Open Science MOOCers and interested individuals,

The past month has been quite intense for us all, when the Steering Committee has put their heads together to keep the MOOC afloat and reorganize its governance. Module developments and translation work will soon continue and we welcome all your suggestions, input and ideas to any of the debeloping stages along the way.


## Code of Conduct
(ask Bianka and Chris H to write a short notification for this?)


## Tasks distribution

Jon Tennant was performing most of the communication work. We redistributed responsibilities for the different channels as follows:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/opensciencemooc): Lisa Hehnke for important announcements
- [Facebook](https://facebook.com/opensciencemooc): Ivo Grigorov, Jo Havemann
- [info@opensciencemooc.eu](mailto:info@opensciencemooc.eu): Lisa Hehnke, Jo Havemann, Tobias Steiner
- [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC) (pull request reviews, admin work): Tobias Steiner, Danny Colin
- [Eliademy](https://eliademy.com/opensciencemooc): Ivo Grigorov, Tobias Steiner (infrastructure); Jo Havemann, Lisa Hehnke (content)
- [Slack](openmooc-ers.slack.com): Julien Colomb


## Finding a new Learning platform

Eliademy has announced bankruptcy (add url to their announcement) so we are currently looking into alternative platforms. Do you have good experience adn would like to suggest one for the OS-MOOC? Contact us at ((Slack/ public teering channel), Twitter (url) or by email to info@opensciencemooc.eu


**We whish you all a happy end of 2019 and a good start into 2020!
