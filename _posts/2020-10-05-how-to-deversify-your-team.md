# OA call for a more diverse team

After Julien Colomb sent a request for a more diverse team members for his [jams open source initiative](https://github.com/jam-schema/jams), 
Andre Maia Chagas followed up, expressing similar problems for his [Open Neuroscience project](https://open-neuroscience.com/en/). 
The two decided to ask for help to determine what they could do in the hope to attract a more diverse crowd in their project, 
that are lead mostly or even exclusively by white male men.
