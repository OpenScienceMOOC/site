Good news everyone!

The first module of the Open Science MOOC, on Open Research Software and Open Source, passed 500 participants! People from more than a dozen different countries have also already finished the module and earned their certificate of completion. As well as that, more than 120 tasks have been completed, with folks learning cool skills like how to setup and create a welcoming community around a GitHub project, indexing such projects in Zenodo, and integrating Git into an RStudio workflow. We wrote an article recently about how important it is to have Open Source as a core part of Open Science for [OpenSource.com](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/open-science-git).

We would like to extend our thanks and gratitude to everyone who has helped by either sharing information about the MOOC, joining the active community, or cheerleading for us. We are incredibly proud of the community at this early stage in our development, and excited for the future. Especially as we are super close to launching the next module on Open Principles. Stay tuned...

For now, don't forget that the course is totally [free to join](https://eliademy.com/catalog/oer/module-5-open-research-software-and-open-source.html), and all content is re-usable on or off the platform, so you don't even have to enroll if you want to use or share the materials elsewhere. We welcome people from all backgrounds to join us, irrespective of your knowledge or experience with Open Source, and also have an [open Slack group](https://osmooc.herokuapp.com/) if you want to come along and just have a chit-chat about all things open. Here, we also post news about the MOOC, as well as relevant events and funding opportunities.

A couple of days ago, we also released this **brand new video** for the forthcoming module on Open Principles:

This video is for a task designed for researchers who want to help to build their online profile while helping to amplify their work. Think of this task like a way of creating an online CV for showcasing your research. It teaches four tools you can use for this: 

1. ORCID - A persistent identifier for you and your research. 
2. ImpactStory - A place to document how your research has been shared and re-used online. 
3. Publons - A place to document your peer review activities. 
4. Open Science Framework - A place to openly collaborate on your research.

If you can't wait to learn more, and want to get a sneak peek behind the scenes, drop us an [email](mailto:info@opensciencemooc.eu) and we'll see what we can conjure up.

As always, please do consider helping us out by spreading the word, inviting your friends and colleagues to join us, and giving feedback on how things are going so far. This is a huge, openly collaborative effort, and we will learn together as a community and help set the default to Open!

Cheers,

Jon and the Open Science MOOC team
