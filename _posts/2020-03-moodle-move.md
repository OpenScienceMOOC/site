# Eliademy shut down

In December last year Eliademy was shut down and we have been looking for a different solution to propose our content on a mooc platform.

# What we did so far

Using the wiki (link) function of gitub, we summarised some characteristics of the main platforms we wanted to test. An important factor was not recorded: the number of users we could reach on that platform.

# Moodle tests

After deciding to test moodle extensively, we used a private instance of moodle, as well as oncampus.de. The H5P integration (expecially the creation of quizzes and extra material inside videos) of moodle could be a great tool, but it requires quite a lot of time investment.

# Next steps

We want to test how we could migrate moodle content from one instance to another, in addition, we need to figure out how to host the h5p content (on github?) as well as defined a workflow for pushing github content toward moodle with a minimal amount of manual work (as we expect many updates).
