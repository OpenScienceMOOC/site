**Status**: This module is currently [in development](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-9-Open-Educational-Resources)

## Rationale

Open Educational Resources (OERs) are freely accessible, openly licensed 
materials for teaching and learning, and represent a paradigm shift compared to 
traditional methods of education. They are intrinsically related to developments 
in Open Science, due to the wider implications of access to knowledge in 
education in our global societies. This module will provide an understanding of 
the motivations behind OERs and how to develop your own.

## Learning outcomes

* The researcher will be able to convey the motivations behind the OER movement, 
  and the relationship that this has with Open Science.
* The researcher will be able to identify and implement the steps to either 
  prepare content for educational re-use purposes, or be able to design their 
  own OER.
* The researcher will be able to either identify relevant places where their 
  research can be integrated into Wikipedia, or integrate it themselves if they 
  are a user.
